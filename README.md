# Book Store Project

Welcome to the Book Store Project! This Django-based project serves as an online book store, providing a seamless experience for both administrators and users. The project is organized into several Django apps, each catering to specific functionalities:

- **book**: This app manages book-related models, including `Book`, `Category`, and others.
- **cart**: Responsible for handling the shopping cart logic, enabling users to add, modify, and finalize their book selections.
- **checkout**: Manages the entire checkout process, from order creation to payment handling, ensuring a smooth transaction for users.
- **core**: This app encapsulates the core functionalities, covering the homepage, about us, and contact pages.
- **account**: Manages user-related functionalities, including custom user creation with email confirmation for enhanced security and personalized services. Additionally, this app maintains contact information for efficient communication.

## Django Rest Framework Integration

The Book Store Project now incorporates Django Rest Framework (DRF) to provide a robust API for CRUD operations on various models. Here are some key features related to DRF:

- **API Endpoints**: The project exposes API endpoints for all relevant models, allowing users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete instances using standard HTTP methods.

- **Token Authentication**: Token-based authentication is implemented using the Djoser package, ensuring secure access to API endpoints. Users can obtain authentication tokens for accessing protected resources.

- **Permissions and Validations**: DRF permissions are utilized to control access to specific API views based on user roles. Validations ensure data integrity and consistency.

- **Mixins for Functionality**: DRF mixins are employed to enhance functionality in views, providing common behavior such as creating and updating instances.

- **Search with Django Algolia**: Django Algolia implements efficient and fast search functionality. Users can easily search for specific book, author, publisher or other relevant information, enhancing the overall user experience.
